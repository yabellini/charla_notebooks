* Edzer: I use this to teach two courses: https://r-spatial.org/book
* MArtin Modrak: 
I currently write all my analyses in R markdown, although only sometimes is the knitted markdown actually part of the publication. 

I have one paper (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245103) where also the main text was written exclusively with markdown (source: https://github.com/cas-bioinf/covid19retrospective/). 

The whole statistical analysis (a supplement) for https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.23862 was also written and rendered in rmarkdown (source: https://github.com/martinmodrak/bbs-metaanalysis-bayes/).

* Romain Lesur: we wrote some #rstats tutorials for our ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·  colleagues https://www.book.utilitr.org/
Source: https://github.com/InseeFrLab/utilitR
my main stuff is here https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown

* Ted Laderas: These are the #rstats course notebooks that we used to teach R programming at OHSU: https://github.com/jminnier/sph_r_programming

* Phil McAleer: all of our #psyteachr materials (UofGlasgow School of Psychology and Neuroscience) are made using #rstats markdown and #bookdown if that is any use? Wide selection of different books - stats teaching, data skills, visualisations, glossary. Feel free to check them out. Links to #github pages are there as well

Webpage: https://psyteachr.github.io

* DAvid Hood: There are a couple of things in my GitHub that might be of interest https://github.com/thoughtfulbloke?tab=repositories
In particular I suggest resbaz21dh as an introductory text analysis tutorial as an Rmd, and Road_accident_fatigue which is an Rmd analysis of weekly road crash patterns.
Also, people don't see the code in this but as Rmarkdown syntax in a quarto publication I push the render command to download the latest data and update my local copy for the day, then upload it to https://github.com/thoughtfulbloke
